Document Object Model = DOM
Virtual DOM is an abstraction of DOM that uses in memory objects to manipulate real DOM.
When you want to create a new div in real DOM instead of re-rendering
whole DOM, you can just create React.div object which contains other
objects and manipulations you need. Now with this virtual DOM, you will be
checking the difference between this and your current DOM.
And only the part which is different will be added instead of
re-rendering the whole DOM.
